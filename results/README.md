# Results

This directory contains processed results and visualizations generated by analysis scripts.

## Structure

- `figures/` - Generated plots and visualizations (PDF and PNG)
  - Learning curves
  - Performance comparisons
  - Scheduler behavior visualizations
  - α(t) evolution plots
  
- `data/` - Processed data files (.pkl format)
  - Statistical summaries
  - Aggregated results across seeds
  - Multi-game comparisons

## Generating Results

All results are generated by scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# From project root
cd scripts

# Generate analysis and figures
python analyze_results.py          # Single game analysis
python analyze_all_games.py        # Multi-game analysis
python generate_paper_figures.py   # Main figures
python generate_alpha_evolution.py # α(t) visualization
```

## Note

- Full experimental logs are in `logging/` (gitignored - too large for version control)
- This directory only contains processed results suitable for sharing
- All figures are publication-quality (300 DPI, PDF + PNG)
